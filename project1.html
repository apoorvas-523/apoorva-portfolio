  <h2>Improved Methods for CSF Management</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Flow-Based Monitoring Prototype | Product Development </p>

  <h3>Clinical Problem</h3>
  <p>
 Current methods of differentiating between patient symptoms derived from illnesses and shunt failure have insufficient accuracy and detect failure after onset of symptoms. This leads to increased costs to the patient and healthcare system along with patient and parent distress.
  </p>
  
 <h3>Need Statement</h3>
  <p>
There is a need for a more proactive detection method for shunt malfunction in order to reduce the number of emergency room visits and diagnostic exams for hydrocephalus patients.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Skills Demonstrated</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Design control thinking (Clinical insights → User Needs → Device Design inputs → Device Design outputs → V&V)</li>
    <li>Risk-based evaluation of failure modes (obstruction, valve dysfunction)</li>
    <li>Experimental design and repeatability considerations (RTM)</li>
    <li>Translating clinical gaps into measurable engineering parameters</li>
    <li>IP, Commercialization and Go-to-market Strategy</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Impact</h3>
  <p>
  Preliminary feasibility testing suggests internal flow variations 
  produce measurable thermal response differences, supporting continued 
  development toward a non-invasive monitoring system.
