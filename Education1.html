    <h3>Clinical Immersion</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Observed <strong>40+ hours of clinical cases</strong> across multiple care settings, including the OR, ICU, and inpatient environments, with exposure to diverse patient populations and clinician roles
      </li>
      <li>
        Shadowed surgeons, nurses, and clinical staff to understand <strong>real-world workflow, decision-making under time pressure,</strong> and device-user interactions
      </li>
      <li>
        Documented recurring <strong>unmet clinical needs</strong> and pain points related to usability, workflow inefficiencies, training variability, and patient safety
      </li>
      <li>
        Identified <strong>use-related risks, workarounds,</strong> and sources of variability that could impact device performance, clinical outcomes, and downstream quality
      </li>
      <li>
        Considered constraints of the clinical environment, including sterility, setup time, anatomy variability, cognitive load, and handoffs between users
      </li>
      <li>
        Translated clinical observations into <strong>structured problem and need statements</strong> and preliminary design inputs to inform needs-driven product development
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h3>Needs-Driven Product Development</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Evaluated multiple clinical need gaps identified during clinical immersion using criteria such as <strong>severity, frequency, stakeholder impact,</strong> and adoption barriers
      </li>
      <li>
        Prioritized opportunities through <strong>stakeholder mapping</strong>, considering patients, clinicians, hospitals, and downstream operational teams
      </li>
      <li>
        Developed clear <strong>problem statements and value propositions</strong> prior to exploring solution concepts
      </li>
      <li>
        Explored early-stage solution directions with emphasis on <strong>clinical workflow integration, usability,</strong> and patient safety
      </li>
      <li>
        Considered <strong>cross-functional constraints</strong> during concept evaluation, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Use environment and variability in real-world practice</li>
          <li>Potential regulatory pathway implications tied to intended use and user population</li>
          <li>Quality and post-market considerations, such as complaints, training gaps, and off-label use</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Applied a <strong>systems-level, needs-first product development mindset</strong> aligned with industry best practices for medical device development
      </li>
    </ul>
